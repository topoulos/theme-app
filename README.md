# theme-app
This is just a simple demonstration showing how scss and sass maps combined with a behavior subject in angular can be used to apply a theme to a page.  This exampe does NOT require Angular Material to make it work.  The behavior subject is of course subscribed to in the template to make it performant, and ensure that there are no leaks.  OnPush change detection is utilized to ensure maximum speed and to avoid costly DOM watching.
